- Play the game on the local server

## Project Goals

- Synthesize knowledge of OOP, classes, and JS fundamentals to create a playable game
- Demonstrate good GitHub collaboration and workflow within a large group
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle)
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
- Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data

## Technologies Used

- jQuery
- Mocha & Chai
- Fetch API
